# iGEM-CNN-Regression
This is a model that based on open-source TF-biding-score database.

## Data preprocessing
Since DNA and TF are both made up of a limited number of known components, inspring me of using one-hot encoding.   
One-hot encoding Digitize the characteristics of the classified values, here is an example shows how DNA could be encoded into matrix form to fit deep learning.

## How to use it ?
If you don't have such deep learning background before, don't worry, this will only take a few minutes...  
1. Make sure your computer has a python compilation environment   
Installing python is very easy, see the tutorial here! [Let's begin with Python!](https://www.python.org/downloads/)   

2. Aha! Already with Python?  
    Use this command in cmd(command line mode in windows) below to let your computer have a same model like me!  
    ` $ git clone https://github.com/sysu-software-2020/iGEM-CNN-Regression.git  ` 

    To make sure you don't have to worry about annoying packages, you can install python dependencies here!  
    ` $ pip install -r requirements.txt `  
    
    And last preparation, modify the [absolute path](https://github.com/sysu-software-2020/iGEM-CNN-Regression/blob/d6b46481d815da40d8aa0989c53be9c0ea865d8d/predict.py#L23) of test data(./iGEM-CNN-Regression/data_process/test_file.csv)  
    
    Then run local program to predict your result:
    1. YOUR_TF : TF name.   
    2. YOUR_DNA: biding-site you want to predict.   

    `$ python predict.py YOUR_TF YOUR_DNA`
    
    Example:  
    `$ python predict.py P07269	GAACAACTAGCATCCCCGATAAGACGGAATAGAATAGTAAAGATTGTGATTCATTGGCAGGTCCATTGTCGCATTACTAAATCATAGGCATGGAAATTTCCAGTTCACCATGGAACGACGGT`  
    
    And the result(score) is :  
    `1.62477`  
    
3. Train this deep learning model on your own?
    Additionally, if you want to train datas on your own, modify the model's [training data path](https://github.com/sysu-software-2020/iGEM-CNN-Regression/blob/d6b46481d815da40d8aa0989c53be9c0ea865d8d/train.py#L23) and [test data path](https://github.com/sysu-software-2020/iGEM-CNN-Regression/blob/d6b46481d815da40d8aa0989c53be9c0ea865d8d/train.py#L24) corresponding to your computer.

## Running details
Data processing.  
1. Run data_process/data_process.py which converts data to the csv file and get all_tf.csv, train_file.csv, test_file.csv, respectively
2. Run get_tf_txtfile.py to get the refined tf data in tf_txt.txt
